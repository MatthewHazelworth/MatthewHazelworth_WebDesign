				<div class="p1"><p>The purpose of this study was to examine similarites and differences between motion-based video games (MBVGs) and “real-life” wall/rock climbing and determine the perceived usefulness of utilizing MBVGs when trying to teach someone how to authentically wall/rock climb. 
					A mixed-methods multi-phase intervention with two randomized groups – wall/rock climbing ﬁrst (WF; n = 12) and MBVGs ﬁrst (GF; n = 12) utilizing Xbox One’s Kinect Sports Rivals Rock Climbing – was used. All participants had no prior climbing experience. 
					Results indicated the participants perceived MBVGs and authentic wall/rock climbing were similar concerning climbing tactics/strategies and arm movements, but were different regarding effort and leg, ﬁnger/grip, and jumping movements. Moreover, both the MBVGs and “real-life” wall/rock climbing experiences were needed for a signiﬁcant difference in the participants’ perceived understanding of both the necessary motor skills and tactics/strategies needed to wall/rock climb. 
					In sum, MBVGs may be used as a pedagogical tool to teach strategies of wall/rock climbing, particularly with beginners or those with special needs, but caution must be heeded due to perceived effort and lower extremity movement differences compared to authentic climbing.

				<div class="p2"><p>Video gaming hasreachedepicproportionswithinthe UnitedStates.Annualcomputerandvideogamesales increased from $10.1 billion in 2009 to $15.4 billion in2013(Siwek,2014).
					Fifty-ninepercentofallAmericans play video games with the average gamer being 31 years old and 48% being female (Entertainment Software Association [ESA], 2014). 
					The average US household has two video game players with 51% of these households owning at least one dedicated game console (ESA, 2014). Moreover, 88% of youth between 8 and 18 years play video games 3–4 times per week with average weekly playing times of over 16 h for boys and over 9 h for girls (Gentile, 2009). 
					Likewise,on an average schoolday, 41.3% of US high school students play video or computer games (or use a computer for something other than school work) for at least 3 h (Kann et al., 2014). </p></div>
					<div class="p3"><p>More than two-thirds of Americans are overweight or obese (Institute of Medicine, 2015).
									Furthermore, less than one-quarter of American youth aged 12–15 years engage in the recommended daily amount of 60 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (PA) with a growing trend of decreased PA and increased obesity for this population (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014).
									Moreover, one study involving children 12 years and younger revealed that a strong relationship exists between video game use and increased weight status, whereas television viewing does not, indicating that time spent playing video games (not watching television) replaces PA for this population (Vandewater, Shim, & Caplovitz, 2004).</p></div>
