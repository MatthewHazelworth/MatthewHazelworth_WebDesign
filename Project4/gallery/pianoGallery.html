						<div class="text"><h3>Roland</h3>With its groundbreaking approach to grand-piano modeling, and incredibly realistic sound, touch, and response, Roland’s V-Piano has earned many international awards and accolades since its debut in 2009. It has become the #1 choice for many of the most discerning pianists on the planet. So how does the V-Piano evolve? Introducing the V-Piano Grand! Built into an elegant grand-piano cabinet, and with a unique, multi-channel sound system that reacts naturally and intelligently to your performance, this exquisite instrument blurs the line between digital and acoustic worlds. Stepping up from the previous generation, the V-Piano Grand’s sound generator has been further refined, and new piano models have been added to the onboard library. Welcome to a new world of performance, sophistication, and musical innovation.

						<div class="text"><h3>RK-100s</h3>Appearing in 1984, the RK-100 remote keyboard broke the chains of keyboardists, setting them free to perform as they liked. With a stylish body available in four colors, it allowed the keyboard player to challenge the vocalist or guitarist for the main role on stage.

						Now, thirty years later, the RK has been resurrected. Although beautiful curved surfaces have been added, the essence of the original and very popular design is unchanged. What had been a somewhat large and heavy body has been made more compact and lightweight thanks to modern components such as a slim keyboard. While the original required an external sound module, the new RK-100S contains a built-in analog modeling sound generator.

						New features and functions include two ribbon controllers, an arpeggiator, and a vocoder, and there are also "favorite" buttons that allow you to register frequently-used sounds for one-touch selection. The RK-100S is your choice for smarter, more active, and more enjoyable performance.
