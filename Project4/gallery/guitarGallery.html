						<div class="fender"><h3>Fender Stratocaster</h3>The Fender Stratocaster is a special guitar. The Fender American Standard Stratocaster is a legendary instrument, sought after by many players from the moment they learn to fret a note. 
						The list of players who have relied on the Strat for their sound reads like a who’s-who of guitar history. 
						From Jimi Hendrix, to Yngwie Malmsteen, to Stevie Ray Vaughan, to Eric Clapton — musicians in every genre and style have squeezed incredible sounds out of the Stratocaster,
						And if you find something about you don't like, it's easy enough to swap out parts. Stratocasters are kind of like the “shop cars” of the guitar world. They are easy to work on, 
						and if you’re not happy with some aspect of the guitar you can change it later down the road.

						The SG's devilish points and curves, blistering humbucker tone and fast-playing neck help to make it one of the most coveted and revered 1960s Gibson models.
						This 2018 Gibson Custom Shop Historic '61 SG Standard model continues the legendary magic of the originals with all solid woods, historic hide-glue construction methods, the finest vintage replica parts and materials avaiable and the instantly-recognizable, powerful tone of pure rock 'n roll.
