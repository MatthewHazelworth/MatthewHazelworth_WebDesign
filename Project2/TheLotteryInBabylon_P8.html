				<p>Sometimes a single event—the murder of
					C in a tavern, B's mysterious apotheosis—would
					be the inspired outcome of thirty or forty
					drawings. Combining bets was difficult, but we
					must recall that the individuals of the Company
					were (and still are) all-powerful, and clever. In
					many cases, the knowledge that certain happy
					turns were the simple result of chance would
					have lessened the force of those outcomes; to
					forestall that problem, agents of the Company
					employed suggestion, or even magic. The paths
					they followed, the intrigues they wove, were
					invariably secret. To penetrate the innermost
					hopes and innermost fears of every man, they
					called upon astrologers and spies. There were
					certain stone lions, a sacred latrine called
					Qaphqa, some cracks in a dusty aqueduct—
					these places, it was generally believed, gave
					access to the Company, and well- or ill-wishing
					persons would deposit confidential reports in
					them. An alphabetical file held those dossiers of
					varying veracity.
