				<p>However unlikely it may seem, no one, until
					that time, had attempted to produce a general
					theory of gaming. Babylonians are not a
					speculative people; they obey the dictates of
				</p>
				<p>chance, surrender their lives, their hopes, their
					nameless terror to it, but it never occurs to
					them to delve into its labyrinthine laws or the
					revolving spheres that manifest its workings.
					Nonetheless, the semiofficial statement that I
					mentioned inspired numerous debates of a legal
					and mathematical nature. From one of them,
					there emerged the following conjecture: If the
					Lottery is an intensification of chance, a
					periodic infusion of chaos into the cosmos, then
					is it not appropriate that chance intervene in
					every aspect of the drawing, not just one? Is it
					not ludicrous that chance should dictate a
					person's death while the circumstances of that
					death—whether private or public, whether
					drawn out for an hour or a century—should not
					be subject to chance? Those perfectly
					reasonable objections finally prompted
					sweeping reform; the complexities of the new
					system (complicated further by its having been
					in practice for centuries) are understood by only
					a handful of specialists, though I will attempt to
					summarize them, even if only symbolically.
