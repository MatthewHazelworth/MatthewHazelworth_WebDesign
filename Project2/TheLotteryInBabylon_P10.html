				<p>Let us imagine a first drawing, which
					condemns a man to death. In pursuance of that
					decree, another drawing is held; out of that
					second drawing come, say, nine possible
					executors. Of those nine, four might initiate a
					third drawing to determine the name of the
					executioner, two might replace the unlucky
					draw with a lucky one (the discovery of a
					treasure, say), another might decide that the
					death should be exacerbated (death with
					dishonor, that is, or with the refinement of
					torture), others might simply refuse to carry 
					out the sentence----That is the scheme of the
					Lottery, put symbolically. In reality, the
					number of drawings is infinite. No decision is
					final; all branch into others. The ignorant
					assume that infinite drawings require infinite
					time; actually, all that is required is that time be
					infinitely sub-divisible, as in the famous parable
					of the Race with the Tortoise. That infinitude
					coincides remarkably well with the sinuous
					numbers of Chance and with the Heavenly
					Archetype of the Lottery beloved of Platonists....
					Some distorted echo of our custom seems to
					have reached the Tiber: In his Life of Antoninus 
					Heliogabalus, AElius Lampridius tells us that
					the emperor wrote out on seashells the fate that
					he intended for his guests at dinnerâ€”some
					would receive ten pounds of gold; others, ten
					houseflies, ten dormice, ten bears. It is fair to
					recall that Heliogabalus was raised in Asia
					Minor, among the priests of his eponymous
					god.
