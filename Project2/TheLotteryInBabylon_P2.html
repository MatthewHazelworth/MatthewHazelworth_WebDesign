				<p>Then, in broad daylight, a drawing would be
					held; those smiled upon by fate would, with no
					further corroboration by chance, win coins
					minted of silver. The procedure, as you can see,
					was rudimentary. 
				<p>Naturally, those so-called "lotteries" were a
					failure. They had no moral force whatsoever;
					they appealed not to all a man's faculties, but
					only to his hopefulness. Public indifference 
					soon meant that the merchants who had
					founded these venal lotteries began to lose
					money. Someone tried something new:
					including among the list of lucky numbers a few
					unlucky draws. This innovation meant that
					those who bought those numbered rectangles
					now had a twofold chance: they might win a
					sum of money or they might be required to pay
					a fine—sometimes a considerable one. As one
					might expect, that small risk (for every thirty
					"good" numbers there was one ill-omened one)
					piqued the public's interest. Babylonians
					flocked to buy tickets. The man who bought
					none was considered a pusillanimous wretch, a
					man with no spirit of adventure. In time, this
					justified contempt found a second target: not
					just the man who didn't play, but also the man
					who lost and paid the fine. The Company (as it
					was now beginning to be known) had to protect
					the interest of the winners, who could not be
					paid their prizes unless the pot contained
					almost the entire amount of the fines. A lawsuit
					was filed against the losers: the judge sentenced
					them to pay the original fine, plus court costs, 
					or spend a number of days in jail. In order to
					thwart the Company, they all chose jail. From
					that gauntlet thrown down by a few men sprang
					the Company's omnipotence—its ecclesiastical,
					metaphysical force.
				</p>
				<p>Some time after this, the announcements of
					the numbers drawn began to leave out the lists
					of fines and simply print the days of prison
					assigned to each losing number. That
					shorthand, as it were, which went virtually
					unnoticed at the time, was of utmost
					importance: It was the first appearance of nonpecuniary
					elements in the lottery. And it met
					with great success—indeed, the Company was
					forced by its players to increase the number of
					unlucky draws.
				</p>
				<p>As everyone knows, the people of Babylon
					are great admirers of logic, and even of
					symmetry. It was inconsistent that lucky
					numbers should payoff in round silver coins
					while unlucky ones were measured in days and
					nights of jail. Certain moralists argued that the
					possession of coins did not always bring about
					happiness, and that other forms of happiness
					were perhaps more direct.
