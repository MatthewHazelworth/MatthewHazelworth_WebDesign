				<p>Like all the men of Babylon, I have been
					proconsul; like all, I have been a slave. I have
					known omnipotence, ignominy, imprisonment.
					Look here— my right hand has no index finger.
					Look here — through this gash in my cape you
					can see on my stomach a crimson tattoo—it is
					the second letter, Beth. 
				</p>
				<p>On nights when the moon is full, this symbol
					gives me power over men with the mark of
					Gimel, but it subjects me to those with the
					Aleph, who on nights when there is no moon
					owe obedience to those marked with the Gimel. 
					In the half-light of dawn, in a cellar, standing
					before a black altar, I have slit the throats of
					sacred bulls. Once, for an entire lunar year, I
					was declared invisible — I would cry out and no
					one would heed my call, I would steal bread and
					not be beheaded. I have known that thing the
					Greeks knew not—uncertainty. In a chamber of
					brass, as I faced the strangler's silent scarf,
					hope did not abandon me; in the river of
					delights, panic has not failed me. Heraclides
					Ponticus reports, admiringly, that Pythagoras
					recalled having been Pyrrhus, and before that,
					Euphorbus, and before that, some other mortal;
					in order to recall similar vicissitudes, I have no
					need of death, nor even of imposture.
