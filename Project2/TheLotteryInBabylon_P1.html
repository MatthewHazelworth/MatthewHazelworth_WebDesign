			<p>Like all the men of Babylon, I have been
				proconsul; like all, I have been a slave. I have
				known omnipotence, ignominy, imprisonment.
				Look here— my right hand has no index finger.
				Look here—through this gash in my cape you
				can see on my stomach a crimson tattoo—it is
				the second letter, Beth. 
			</p>
			<p>On nights when the moon is full, this symbol
				gives me power over men with the mark of
				Gimel, but it subjects me to those with the
				Aleph, who on nights when there is no moon
				owe obedience to those marked with the Gimel. 
				In the half-light of dawn, in a cellar, standing
				before a black altar, I have slit the throats of
				sacred bulls. Once, for an entire lunar year, I
				was declared invisible—I would cry out and no
				one would heed my call, I would steal bread and
				not be beheaded. I have known that thing the
				Greeks knew not—uncertainty. In a chamber of
				brass, as I faced the strangler's silent scarf,
				hope did not abandon me; in the river of
				delights, panic has not failed me. Heraclides
				Ponticus reports, admiringly, that Pythagoras
				recalled having been Pyrrhus, and before that,
				Euphorbus, and before that, some other mortal;
				in order to recall similar vicissitudes, I have no
				need of death, nor even of imposture.
			</p>
			<p>I owe that almost monstrous variety to an
				institution—the Lottery— which is unknown in
				other nations, or at work in them imperfectly or
				secretly. I have not delved into this institution's
				history. I know that sages cannot agree. About
				its mighty purposes I know as much as a man
				untutored in astrology might know about the
				moon. Mine is a dizzying country in which the
				Lottery is a major element of reality; until this 
				day, I have thought as little about it as about the
				conduct of the indecipherable gods or of my
				heart.
			</p>
			<p>Now, far from Babylon and its beloved
				customs, I think with some bewilderment about
				the Lottery, and about the blasphemous
				conjectures that shrouded men whisper in the
				half-light of dawn or evening. 
			</p>
			<p>My father would tell how once, long ago—
				centuries? years?—the lottery in Babylon was a
				game played by commoners. He would tell
				(though whether this is true or not, I cannot
				say) how barbers would take a man's copper
				coins and give back rectangles made of bone or
				parchment and adorned with symbols.
