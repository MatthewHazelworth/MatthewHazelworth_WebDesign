				<p>There are also impersonal drawings, whose
					purpose is unclear. One drawing decrees that a
					sapphire from Taprobana be thrown into the
					waters of the Euphrates; another, that a bird be
					released from the top of a certain tower;
					another, that every hundred years a grain of
					sand be added to (or taken from) the countless
					grains of sand on a certain beach. Sometimes,
					the consequences are terrible. 
				</p>		
				<p>Under the Company's beneficent influence,
					our customs are now steeped in chance. The
					purchaser of a dozen amphorae of Damascene
					wine will not be surprised if one contains a
					talisman, or a viper; the scribe who writes out a
					contract never fails to include some error; I
					myself, in this hurried statement, have
					misrepresented some splendor, some atrocity—
					perhaps, too, some mysterious monotony....
					Our historians, the most perspicacious on the
					planet, have invented a method for correcting
					chance; it is well known that the outcomes of
					this method are (in general) trust-worthy—
					although, of course, they are never divulged
					without a measure of deception. Besides, there
					is nothing so tainted with fiction as the history
					of the Company....A paleographie document,
					unearthed at a certain temple, may come from
					yesterday's drawing or from a drawing that took
					place centuries ago. No book is published
					without some discrepancy between each of the
					edition's copies. Scribes take a secret oath to
					omit, interpolate, alter. Indirect falsehood is
					also practiced.
