					elements in the lottery. And it met

					forced by its players to increase the number of
					unlucky draws.

					are great admirers of logic, and even of
					symmetry. It was inconsistent that lucky
					numbers should payoff in round silver coins
					while unlucky ones were measured in days and
					nights of jail. Certain moralists argued that the
					possession of coins did not always bring about
					happiness, and that other forms of happiness
					were perhaps more direct. </p>
